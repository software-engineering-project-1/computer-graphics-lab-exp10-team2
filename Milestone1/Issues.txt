Issue 1: The application doesn't run in as a stand alone. It gives access control exception, java.io.FilePermission error. Looks to be a applet error.
Issue 2: The invalid input co-ordinates enter into the "Enter co-ordinates" text box doesn't give the error message but simply ignores it. It should give the proper error message
Issue 3: When clicked on "Start Experiment with Default Values"  it displays the "Enter" button behind "Next iteration" button. The "Enter" button should not be displayed.
Issue 4. The page doesn't refresh when experiment starts with the Default Values
